how to use the skinny mann level creator

*note it may be nessarry to manualy edit the level file in sime instances


if you can be bother to read this check out the tutorial playlist here: I have not created it yet pls contact jSdCool with any questions


the basics:
after loading or creating a new level you are placed into the editor
at the top there are sevaral squares with are tools to use while making the level
the first square is the pause/play simulation button
when clicked it will eather pause or un pause the "simulation"
then the triangel is visible the "simulation" is paused, this menas charicters wont move and you are basicly in edit mode
*note you can also edit the level when the "simulation" is not paused
when in edit mode (paused simulation) you can use the left and right arrow keys to move the camera left and right
when in simulation mode you can use a/d to mode left and right and space to make the mann jump



How to ground tool:
the ground tool is next to the pause/play button
when selected the user can click and drag a box across the screen that the player can stand on
under the tools 3 black bars will appear, these are RGB sliders
click and drag the white boxes on the left to select colors    this will be the color of the ground that is drawn
*note for the colors of the terain that are used in the built in game levels look in the color info.txt file



How to checkpoint tool:
the checkpoint tool is next to the ground tool
when selected click on the screen to place a checkpoint
when the player is standing on the checkpoint there spawn point will be reset to that point


How to finish line tool:
the finish line tool is next to the checkpoint tool 
click anywhere on the screenw to place a finish line 
the levcel will be complete when the player stand in its hitbox

How to delete tool:
the delete tool is next to the finish line tool
simply click on any thing pervously placed down to remove it

How to move player tool:
the move player tool is next to the delete tool
this tool move the player to the mouse position when clicked

How to grid mode:
the grid mode tool is next to the move player tool:
when activated any ground that is drawn will automaticly snap to an invisible grid of the size specified on the tool
to change the size of the grid simply scroll up or down on your mouse while grid mode is on

How to advanced:
for all advanced actions you will need to manualy edit the level file 
for now the level file will be named "levelnamwe".json
it is recomended that you use a texteditor like notepad++ to open this file but notepad will allso do fine

Tweaking level settings:
the verry first groop of things in this file will look like this,
{
    "level type": "level",
    "level_id": XXXXXXXXX,
    "name": "test",
    "spawnX": 20,
    "spawn pointX": 20,
    "game version": "0.0.0.4_BETA",
    "spawn pointY": 700,
    "spawnY": 700
  },

editing this grop will be most of what you will probubly want to do
leave the level type, level_id, and name feild alone
if you want a coustome level spawn position then change the spawn pointX and spawn pointY values
additinaly change the spawnX and spawnY values to make the player tart at those positions

updating to a newer game version:
to do this it may be a case of simply editing the game version feild however more may need to be added in the futcher



accual objects:
{
    "dx": 260,
    "color": -16777215,
    "dy": 180,
    "x": 200,
    "y": 360,
    "type": "ground"
  },
{
    "x": 2691,
    "y": 367,
    "type": "check point"
  },
{
    "x": 2595,
    "y": 163,
    "type": "goal"
  }

these are the structures for the ground checkoints and finish lines
edit thees values for fine tuning of your level
